• The project detects False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) in smart grids using a privacy-enhancing 
cross-silo federated learning framework. 
• The proposed system integrates double-layer encryption and Shamir secret sharing to ensure secure 
model aggregation while allowing client dropouts and rejoining. 
• Machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SGD, and 
Random Forest are employed, achieving an accuracy of 96-97%. 
• The system is efficient, scalable, and robust, suitable for real-world smart grid security applications.
